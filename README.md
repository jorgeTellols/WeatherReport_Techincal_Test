# Weather Report app

IMPORTANT: This app is a technical test.

## What's this?

This is a very simple application to check the weather report from 3 random cities. 

## What can you do?

- Check the weather, temperature, wind speed, humidity and rain probability from 3 cities on the current moment.
- Check the weather, average temperature and rain probability of this same city within the next 6 days.
- Switch between languages (The site is fully in English and Spanish)
- Leave me your contact through a form (the submit button is not functional).

## Technologies used

- NodeJS v20.16.0
- React 
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

No frameworks used (technically React is a library hehe).

## How do I navigate through the files?

This is a single page site, so eveything has its root on App.jsx. You can reach anything from there.

I tried to be "clear" while I was organizing eveyrthing so you'll find eveything separated with folders. Here is the syntax I used to organize myself:

- C = component (simple components like buttons or inputs)
- W = widget (more complex components like the sidebar or the main waeather widget itself)
- M = modal (components that displays a modal)

Every picture I used can be found in the folder "/public/assets" and the translation files in the "utils" folder.

All the style was done in "App.css". It's a long file so to make the reading easy I separated eveything in sections with comments. I also commented other parts of the code.
