# Weather Report app

Important: This app is a technical test.

This is a very simple application to check the weather report from 3 random cities (you can select them from the sidebar). You can also switch language (English and Spanish) and access a form to message me anything (the form is not functional, only a design as I was told to do).

Made with ReactJS and native JavaScript, HTML and CSS. No frameworks used.
