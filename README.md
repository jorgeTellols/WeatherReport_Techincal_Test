# Weather Report app

IMPORTANT: This app is a technical test.

## What's this?

This is a very simple application to check the weather report from 3 random cities. 

## What can you do?

- Check the weather, temperature and rain probability from a random city (pick them from the left sidebar) on the current day and the next 5.
- Switch between languages (The site is fully in ENglish and Spanish)
- Leave me your contact through a form to be able reach you in the future (the submit button is not functional).

## Technologies used

- React 
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

No frameworks used (technically React is a library hehe).

## How do I navigate through the files?

This is a single page site, so eveything has its root on App.css. You can reach anything from there.

I tried to be "clear" while I was coding this app but here is the syntax I used to organize myself:

- C = component
- W = widget
- M = modal

All the style can be found in "App.css", to make is easy the reading of it I separated eveything in sections with comments.
